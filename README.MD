Gems I would have used in a non-assessment scenario:

Gon - to pass variables to javascript.

HTTParty - For the API call (ended up using this as ruby net/http implementation seemed sloppier.)

Paperclip - To resize and save images server-side for quicker loading client-side.

Rails - For all the rails stuff.


JS libraries I would have used:

Moment.js - for time stuff

Jquery - for adding and subtracting classes to control color instead of direct style addition. (ended up using this as pure javascript implementation seemed sloppier.)

Challenges:

How to portray time.

How to determine current status of meetings.

How to change colors.
